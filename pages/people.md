#This is how I made the customized "People" page that can be seen in the Black Library Exhibit. You can make a unique cloud page from any column of data in your metadata sheet. Be sure to edit line (or duplicate and edit) 30 - 33 of the theme.yml if you want to use a different column of metadata! 
title: People
layout: cloud
permalink: /people.html
cloud-fields: people
# Default subject page is configured in "_data/theme.yml"

# leave cloud-fields as "site.data.theme.people-fields"

#Be sure to add the page to the config-nav.csv in the "data" folder
